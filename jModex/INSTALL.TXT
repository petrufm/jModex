jModex 

Version 0.8

1. From Eclipse, check out the root jModex (old name 
WebAppModelling) folder as a project into your workspace.

2. Run the project as an Eclipse application 
(Run -> Run As -> Eclipse Application).

3. Into the new instance of Eclipse, create a new
Java project. The project must contain the Java 
code of the translated JSP. The project should be 
configured (e.g. specify the libraries of the 
project, etc.)

4. Right-click on the project. The Spacios menu
will be available. Click on Spacios -> jModex -> 
Infer Aslan++.

NOTES
The analyzed project must be compiled with Java 1.6. 
As a consequence, please run the tests with a Java 1.6
machine.
